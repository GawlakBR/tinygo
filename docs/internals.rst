Compiler internals
==================

Pipeline
--------

Like most compilers, TinyGo is a compiler built as a pipeline of
transformations, that each translate an input to a simpler output version (also
called lowering). However, most of these part are not in TinyGo itself. The
frontend is mostly implemented by external Go libraries, and most optimizations
and code generation is implemented by LLVM.

This is roughly the pipeline for TinyGo:

  * Lexing, parsing, typechecking and `AST
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`_ building is done by
    packages in the `standard library <https://godoc.org/go>`_ and in the
    `golang.org/x/tools/go library <https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go>`_.
  * `SSA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form>`_
    construction (a very important step) is done by the
    `golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa <https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa>`_
    package.
  * This SSA form is then analyzed by the `ir package
    <https://godoc.org/github.com/aykevl/tinygo/ir>`_ to learn all kinds of
    things about the code that help the optimizer.
  * The Go SSA is then transformed into LLVM IR by the `compiler package
    <https://godoc.org/github.com/aykevl/tinygo/compiler>`_. Both forms are SSA,
    but because Go SSA is higher level and contains Go-specific constructs (like
    interfaces and goroutines) this is non-trivial. However, the vast majority
    of the work is simply lowering the available Go SSA into LLVM IR, possibly
    calling some runtime library intrinsics in the process (for example,
    operations on maps).
  * This LLVM IR is then optimized by the LLVM optimizer, which has a large
    array of standard `optimization passes
    <https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html>`_. Currently, the standard optimization
    pipeline is used as is also be used by Clang, but a pipeline better tuned
    for TinyGo might be used in the future.
  * After all optimizations have run, a few fixups are needed for AVR for
    globals. This is implemented by the compiler package.
  * Finally, the resulting machine code is emitted by LLVM to an object file, to
    be linked by an architecture-specific linker in a later step.

After this whole list of compiler phases, the Go source has been transformed
into object code. It can then be emitted directly to a file (for linking in a
different build system), or it can be linked directly or even be flashed to a
target by TinyGo (using external tools under the hood).

Differences from ``go``
-----------------------

  * A whole program is compiled in a single step, without intermediate linking.
    This makes incremental development much slower for large programs but
    enables far more optimization opportunities. In the future, an option should
    be added for incremental compilation during edit-compile-test cycles.
  * Interfaces are always represented as a ``{typecode, value}`` pair. `Unlike
    Go <https://research.swtch.com/interfaces>`_, TinyGo will not precompute a
    list of function pointers for fast interface method calls. Instead, all
    interface method calls are looked up where they are used. This may sound
    expensive, but it avoids memory allocation at interface creation.
  * Global variables are computed during compilation whenever possible (unlike
    Go, which does not have the equivalent of a ``.data`` section). This is an
    important optimization for several reasons:
      * Startup time is reduced. This is nice, but not the main reason.
      * Initializing globals by copying the initial data from flash to RAM costs
        much less flash space as only the actual data needs to be stored,
        instead of all instructions to initialize these globals.
      * Data can often be statically allocated instead of dynamically allocated
        at startup.
      * Dead globals are trivially optimized away by LLVM.
      * Constant globals are trivially recognized by LLVM and marked
        ``constant``. This makes sure they can be stored in flash instead of
        RAM.
      * Global constants are useful for constant propagation and thus for dead
        code elimination (like an ``if`` that depends on a global variable).
